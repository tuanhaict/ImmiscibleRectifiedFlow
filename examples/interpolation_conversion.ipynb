Intuitively, the ODE model ensures that the total \"mass\" or \"particles\" passing through any small local area remains the same after rectifying. As a result, the distributions of $\\{Z_t\\}_t$ (simulated using the ODE) and $\\{X_t\\}_t$ (from the interpolation process) are guaranteed to be the same.
